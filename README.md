Google Glass Project For Sepsis Patient Decision Support

Team iHuman
Casey Wilson, Hoc Vo, George Pantazes, Sushil Khadka, Jonathan King

This project aims at using the Google Glass technology to provide clinical data and intelligent decision support to doctors in cases of Sepsis so they can provide informed, quality care that can potentially save lives. If you are motivated to work on a challenging project that uses cutting edge technology to save lives, read on.

==================

Running the Glassware on Glass
You can use your IDE to compile and install the sample or use adb on the command line:

$ adb install -r TimerSample.apk

To start the sample, say "ok glass, start a timer" from the Glass clock screen or use the touch menu.

===================

What is SEPSIS:
Sepsis is an overwhelming immune response to infection, which damages its own tissues and organs. It can happen at any age, regardless of health condition and many times from seemingly benign incidents (e.g. a playground scrape). Severe sepsis strikes 18 million people every year, 750,000 being Americans and it have very high mortality rate that ranges from 28% to 50%. It is the leading cause of ICU deaths, accounting for 60-80% deaths in developing countries. It kills more than 6 million infants and young children world-wide every year. Diagnosis of sepsis is often delayed due to its difficulty to diagnose despite the rapid deterioration of the patient. To summarize, sepsis is an ubiquitous omnipotent killer that literally and figuratively can cost us an arm and a leg, and does not discriminate against sex, ethnicity, social status or age.

What have we done so far:
Prof. Tagkopoulos has teamed up with several professors in the Medical School that are world experts in Sepsis to mine the electronic health records of the UCD Medical System for patterns, patient outcomes, action-based transitions, etc. His group has created a decision support prototype based on sophisticated machine learning algorithms to provide the actions that are most likely to lead to a favorable outcome, given the patient state.

What needs to be done:
The student team will work on adapting the decision support GUI and infrastructure to Google Glass, a mounted head-display from Google. The team has already one Google Glass in their possession and they will get several more through collaboration with Google. The project consists of the following modules: (a) back-end server, DB and algorithmic configuration, (b) implementation of a client app on Google Glass with interactive GUI, (c) communication between front-end and back-end (client-server communication), (d) testing on a simulated setting (Center for Health and Technology, Sacramento) and tool refinement through feedback from survey.

Qualifications:
Google Glass is easy to program (resemblance to HTML), but it will be challenging to create a GUI that will be intuitive and at the same time it will maximize the amount of relevant information given to the physicians. The team will have to exploit wireless, GPS, voice and optical recognition features of Google Glass. Creating a stable, sustainable database and communication environment between the GGlass and the server is paramount, so knowledge of SQL, C++, Python/Perl is desired. The team will need to keep an up-to-date online blog on the project progress, write a short bi-weekly report and meet regularly.
